# IAP Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. Receipt Validation Endpoint
**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/iap/validate`

- ✅ Validates iOS (App Store) and Android (Google Play) receipts (MOCK)
- ✅ Creates subscription via SubscriptionManager
- ✅ Creates and marks invoice as paid via InvoiceService
- ✅ Grants entitlements (`groupReplay: true` for IAP)
- ✅ Writes to ledger for audit trail
- ✅ Includes idempotency middleware
- ✅ Proper authentication and authorization checks

### 2. Webhook Endpoints

#### App Store Webhooks
**Endpoint:** `POST /webhooks/appstore`

Supported events:
- ✅ `INITIAL_BUY` - First purchase
- ✅ `DID_RENEW` - Successful renewal
- ✅ `DID_FAIL_TO_RENEW` - Failed renewal (grace period handling)
- ✅ `REFUND` - Refund issued (immediate cancellation + entitlement revocation)
- ✅ `CANCEL` - User cancelled (cancelAtPeriodEnd)

#### Google Play Webhooks
**Endpoint:** `POST /webhooks/play`

Supported events:
- ✅ Type `1` (SUBSCRIPTION_RECOVERED)
- ✅ Type `2` (SUBSCRIPTION_RENEWED)
- ✅ Type `3` (SUBSCRIPTION_CANCELED)
- ✅ Type `7` (SUBSCRIPTION_RESTARTED)
- ✅ Type `10` (SUBSCRIPTION_PAUSED)
- ✅ Type `11` (SUBSCRIPTION_PAUSE_SCHEDULE_CHANGED)
- ✅ Type `12` (SUBSCRIPTION_REVOKED) - Refund

### 3. Webhook Event Handlers

#### Renewal Handler
- ✅ Updates subscription status to `active`
- ✅ Extends period by 30 days
- ✅ Creates renewal invoice
- ✅ Writes to ledger
- ✅ Clears grace period if present

#### Renewal Failure Handler
- ✅ Sets subscription to `past_due`
- ✅ Starts grace period (7 days default)
- ✅ Keeps entitlements active during grace
- ✅ Writes failure to ledger

#### Refund Handler
- ✅ Cancels subscription immediately
- ✅ Revokes all entitlements
- ✅ Writes refund to ledger

#### Cancellation Handler
- ✅ Sets `cancelAtPeriodEnd: true`
- ✅ User retains access until period ends
- ✅ Writes cancellation to ledger

#### Pause Handler (Android)
- ✅ Sets subscription to `paused` status
- ✅ Temporarily revokes entitlements
- ✅ Can be resumed later

### 4. Integration with Services

- ✅ **SubscriptionManager**: Creates and manages subscriptions
- ✅ **InvoiceService**: Handles invoice creation and payment marking
- ✅ **EntitlementService**: Manages feature flags via SubscriptionManager
- ✅ **Ledger**: All events written for audit trail
- ✅ **Idempotency**: Webhooks deduplicated automatically

### 5. Entitlement Logic

| Provider | oneToOne | groupReplay | androidNoReplay |
|----------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Stripe   | ✅ true  | ❌ false    | N/A             |
| IAP (iOS)| ❌ false | ✅ true     | ❌ false        |
| IAP (Android) | ❌ false | ✅ true | ✅ true         |

### 6. Firestore Collections Updated

1. ✅ `subscriptions` - IAP subscription records
2. ✅ `invoices` - Invoice records with paid status
3. ✅ `payments` - Payment records
4. ✅ `entitlements` - User feature toggles
5. ✅ `ledger` - Complete audit trail
6. ✅ `billingCustomers` - Customer metadata
7. ✅ `webhookEvents` - Webhook deduplication

### 7. Documentation

- ✅ `API_EXAMPLES.md` - Updated with IAP webhook examples
- ✅ `IAP_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation guide
- ✅ `postman_collection.json` - Updated with correct webhook endpoints

### 8. Postman Collection

Added/Updated requests:
- ✅ Validate Apple Receipt
- ✅ Validate Google Play Receipt  
- ✅ Get IAP Subscriptions
- ✅ Apple App Store Webhook (Renewal)
- ✅ Apple App Store Webhook (Refund)
- ✅ Google Play Webhook (Renewal)
- ✅ Google Play Webhook (Cancellation)

### 9. Testing Capabilities

All endpoints support:
- ✅ Idempotency testing (duplicate webhook handling)
- ✅ Grace period testing (failed renewals)
- ✅ Entitlement verification
- ✅ Ledger audit trail verification
- ✅ Multi-platform testing (iOS and Android)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Mock Implementation
- All receipts validate successfully
- Mock transaction IDs generated
- Mock amount: $9.99 USD
- Mock renewal period: 30 days
- Mock product ID: `com.edtech.group.premium`

### Ready for Production
To move to production:
1. Implement real Apple App Store Server API verification
2. Implement real Google Play Developer API verification
3. Add proper signature/JWT verification for webhooks
4. Configure environment variables for API keys
5. Handle sandbox vs production environments
